# Pegh

Summary: a small library that I use as a foundation for my GitHub projects. It allows me to keep objects and algorithms secret, i.e. they are not published on github.

## What does *Pegh* mean?

According to a [Klingon to English Dictionary](http://www.movies-dictionary.org/Klingon-to-English-Dictionary/pegh) the word means *secret*.

A key for me to publish code on github was to turn all 'personal' elements of the code into *secrets* that are not available to anyone.

## Can it be useful to you?

Yes. Have a look at the [Backbend project](https://github.com/aspenlaub/Backbend/) on how to implement and use secrets, that is: secret serializable objects as well as secret algorithms provided in Powershell.
